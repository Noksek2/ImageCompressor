## Details
This is a beta version and feature support is still incomplete, as I personally use JPG files most of the time. Currently, the only conversion confirmed to be stable is:

JPG -> JPG

## Known Issues 🐛
There are bugs with WebP <-> JPG conversions.

These issues are scheduled to be fixed.

## Usage Notes ⚠️
-By default, the Quality setting cannot be set higher than 95.

-If you attempt an unsupported conversion, an error message will appear. Please read the message carefully.

-Also, even if I receive bug reports, I might not fix them because I'm lazy.


To translate with Gemini is funny haha
